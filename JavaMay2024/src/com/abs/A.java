// 33% abstraction

// abstraction: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
// In Java, abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
	// Abstract class achieve abstraction 0 to 100%
	// Interface achieve abstraction 100%

// abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.



// Abstract class: A class that is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class.
	// It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
	// It cannot be instantiated.
    // It can have constructors and static methods.
    // It can have final methods.
	// It can have main() method.
	// It can have static block.
	// It can have instance block.
    // It can have instance variables.
    // It can have static variables.
	// It can have final variables.
    // It can have final variables.
    // It can have final methods.
// if we have at least single abstract method in a class, then the class must be declared as abstract.


// Encapsulation: 
// Access modifiers: private, default, protected, public
// Exception handling: try, catch, finally, throw, throws
// Final keyword: final class, final method, final variable
// static keyword: static block, static method, static variable
